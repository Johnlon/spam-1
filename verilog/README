        Fix GitHub issue #356 - use pull strength for tri0/tri1 tie-offs.

        When connecting module inout ports, an island is created. If there
        is no other driver on one of the island ports, a tie-off is added.
        In the case of a tri0 or tri1 net, this must have the correct (pull)
        drive strength.
