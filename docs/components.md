# Componets Research

These components may or may mot be useful. These are notes I took when surveying what's out there.

## Data sheets, books and papers

[Texas Instruments classic data books as PDF](https://www.rsp-italy.it/Electronics/Databooks/Texas%20Instruments/index.htm)

[Only incompatibility is LS driving HC inputs - see "Logic Levels and chip types doc"](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AN-368.pdf.pdf): _"The input high logic level of HC is the only source of incompatibility. 54HC/74HC can drive TTL easily and its input low level is TTL compatible. Again referring to Table 1, the logic output of the TTL type device will be recognized to be a valid logic low (0) level, so there is no incompatibility here. 
Table 2 shows that the specified output drive of HC is capable of
driving many LS-TTL inputs, so there is no incompatibility
here either (although one should be aware of possible fanout
restrictions similar to that encountered when designing with
TTL)."_ 

[Phillips - Logic User Guide 1997](https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/user-manual/HCT_USER_GUIDE.pdf
)
VHC = HC but faster

### Generating Clocks, Delays and Pulses

http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ee100/docs/Chapter8.pdf

But see also my page on "Clocks" and "_Don't mess with the clock_".

Also https://youtu.be/lO_9Zz5jzAA?t=3841


## Registers

- Latches: Outputs follow inputs while latch enable is not enabled. 
- Registers : Output assume input value when clocked

Quest: Where is the 8 bit register with +ve edge, /WE and tristate!! The 4 bit [74LS173](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn54173.pdf), has clock, OE, WE = but only 4 bits (16 pin package)

"_The user should note that because the clocks are not gated with the Direction and Output Enable pins, data at the A and B ports may be clocked into the storage flipâ€“flops at any time"_ - so no Write enable facility.|

**4BIT** 

- [74HC173](https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT173.pdf) - These 4 bit registers have it all; +ve edge, write enable and output tristate.

## RAM / ROM

- [IDT6116](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/464/IDT_6116_DST_2014115-882651.pdf) DIP 24 and fast and cheap [Â£3.50 at mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/Semiconductors/Memory-ICs/SRAM/_/N-4bzpt?P=1z0z63x&Keyword=IDT6116SA&FS=True)

- DIP48 4k8x dual port ram with no arbitration and seems to support port to port without complication ? [IDT7134LA20PDG](https://www.idt.com/document/dst/7134-data-sheet) - perhaps the ones that have BUSY are the same if I ignore the BUSY. On EBAY and alos [Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/IDT/7134LA20PDG?qs=sGAEpiMZZMt9mBA6nIyysK6VW3GrAnbaqQoVOszpZFY%3D) Â£14

- 1kx8 DUAL PORT SRAM 7130LA35PDG Â£7.98 [Farnell](https://uk.farnell.com/integrated-device-technology/7130la35pdg/sram-8kbit-1kx8bit-35ns-pdip-48/dp/2828434?MER=bn_para_1TP_LastViewed_3)

- DIP [U635H256CSC25](https://www.ic-datasheet.com/Electronics/AjABY1xiAGJXewh7AWMCNgBnBWlbblBhCzYACg80U2YAYwFjDjUDZAYrBnAGNgJj/Integrated-Circuit/U635H256CSC25.html) 32kx8 NVRAM cheap - use for program memory as a lot faster than EEPROM and SRAM is autoloaded from internal NV memory on power on. Seen on [ebay for $7.99](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ZMD-U635H256CD1C25-Powerstore-32K-x-8-NVSRAM-DIP28-x-1pc-/152463636104)

- DIP 32x8 NVSRAM [M48Z35-70PC1](https://uk.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/m48z35-70pc1/ic-sram-zeropower-256k/dp/1467739?st=M48Z35)

- SOIC STK14C and STK15C NVRAM 32x8 seen at [Farnell](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/82014.pdf), the STK14C88 & STK16C88 are apparently better if the power down is very fast

- STK12C68 64kx8 NVRAM

- 64kx16 MRAM - Â£11.38 - https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/144/MR0A16A_Datasheet-1511324.pdf - non volatile 35ns - less hassle than EEPROM and faster but needs an adapter to DIP - use in place of 32k RAM / 32k ROM - and more expensive too though. Because of separate 2x8 bit tristate output enable it can work as 64kx16 or 128kx8. ??? Data sheet says 4v

## Breadboard

- [Bus Board Systems BB830](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/BusBoard-Prototype-Systems/BB830?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtgbBHFKsFQgkU9HqdjFsiq3piHUASHS%252BU%3D)

[Ben Eater discusses this board](https://youtu.be/HtFro0UKqkk?t=810) and also fakes. There is also a great YT video by someone else that compares the various bread board brands. 

Mine come from Mouser, a distributor for Bus Board.
But mine look different to those Ben used. Mine have "_BusBoard.com_" in a small font at one end, as [shown on the manufacturer's website](https://www.busboard.com/BB830). Ben's do not have the URL but Ben's do seem to match the [image shown on Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/images/busboardprototypesystems/lrg/bb830_SPL.jpg) and also on the [BB830 data sheet on Mouser](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/58/BPS-DAT-(BB830-KIT)-Datasheet-1282386.pdf). 

Presumably the design of the board has changed slightly since 2016; lets hope the change is cosmetic and doesn't impact the quality of the boards. This diversity in appearance might make it more difficult to identify genuine parts.
